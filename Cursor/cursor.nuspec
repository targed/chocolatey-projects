## Summary

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that integrates advanced features to enhance software development efficiency. 
It's built on top of VSCode, allowing users to easily migrate their favorite extensions, themes, and keybindings. 
Cursor leverages OpenAI's GPT models, including GPT-4, to provide real-time coding assistance, bug detection, and fixes, as well as code generation capabilities from simple instructions
