## Package Parameters

You can pass additional parameters to customize the installation:

### Only on installation:
- `/NoPortable` - Disables portable mode by removing the portable marker file. This will cause Grayjay to store user data in `%APPDATA%\Grayjay` instead of the installation directory.
- `/NoShortcut` - Prevents creation of a desktop shortcut.

### Only on uninstallation:
- `/RemoveAppData` - Removes the user data in the `%APPDATA%\Grayjay` directory during uninstallation of the not portable version. 

**Example Usage:**
```
choco install grayjay --params="/NoPortable /NoShortcut"
choco uninstall grayjay --params="/RemoveAppData"
```
